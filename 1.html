<p>In the year 2092. Earth has become nearly uninhabitable due to tree
     loss and increased desertification. Fleeing the sick earth, 
     the UTS corporation builds a new orbiting home for humanity 
     that mimics the natural processes on Earth. However, 
     only a chosen few are permitted to ascend and become UTS citizens, 
     while those remaining on Earth breathe in polluted air and fight 
     to feed their families while struggling through frequent natural 
     and man-made calamities. Under guidance from the UTS founder and 
     CEO, James Sullivan, the company is working towards making Mars 
     a new Earth, growing genetically modified plants on the planet 
     and turning it into a hospitable environment for humans.</p>
